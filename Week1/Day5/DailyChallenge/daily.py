#Challenge 1: Letter Index Dictionary
#Goal: Create a dictionary that stores the indices (number of the position) of each letter in a word provided by the user(input()).
#1. User Input:
#Ask the user to enter a word.
#Store the input word in a variable.
#2. Creating the Dictionary:
#Iterate through each character of the input word using a loop.
#And check if the character is already a key in the dictionary.
#    * If it is, append the current index to the list associated with that key.
#    * If it is not, create a new key-value pair in the dictionary.
#Ensure that the characters (keys) are strings.
#Ensure that the indices (values) are stored in lists.
#3. Expected Output:
#For the input “dodo”, the output should be: {"d": [0, 2], "o": [1, 3]}.
#For the input “froggy”, the output should be: {"f": [0], "r": [1], "o": [2], "g": [3, 4], "y": [5]}.
#For the input “grapes”, the output should be: {"g": [0], "r": [1], "a": [2], "p": [3], "e": [4], "s": [5]}.
